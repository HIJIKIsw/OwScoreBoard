# OwScoreBoard Documentation

## About

OwScoreBoard is an overlay for use with OBS that displays the starting rating and win-loss record for live Overwatchâ„¢ streams.  This is a purely cosmetic overlay and does not collect or report any gameplay statistics.
Match results are manually updated via a button press in the controller panel, or configurable hotkey.  A customizable win-loss animation screen is displayed following a match result update.

## Usage

After configuring OwScoreBoard with OBS, execute **OwScoreBoardController.exe**.  This will bring up the controller panel.

There are three sections:

### Today's Score

Displays the current win-loss record.  These values will be updated automatically by the buttons in Quick Action, however, they may be changed at any time which will then be reflected in the overlay.

### Starting Rate

Displays the Skill Rating at the beginning of the stream.  This is set manually and will not change.

### Quick Actions

Press Win, Lose or Draw buttons after a match to increment the corresponding counter to update Today's Score.  If enabled, the win-loss animation screen will be displayed after a button press.  Pressing Reset will set all win-loss record values to zero after confirming a prompt but the Starting Rate value will remain.

## Options and Settings

### Always on Top
When enabled, this option will keep the controller panel on top of other windows.

### Suspend Updates
When enabled, this option will disable any updates to the overlay.

### Settings
This will bring up a tabbed panel which allows customization of the win-loss animation screen and hotkeys.
